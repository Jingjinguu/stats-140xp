## Academic Projects

### Quant Signal (Los Angeles, CA)

**Market Analysis Intern** | Jun 2025 - Aug 2025

* Used R for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, applying statistical methods such as correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and time-series summarization to extract insights from AI-generated financial reports.

* Authored daily market updates for 2,500+ users by synthesizing R visualizations with real-time financial news, highlighting emerging patterns and potential market movements.

* Monitored live data dashboards, implemented threshold-based and statistical anomaly detection, and issued timely alerts that helped the community respond quickly to unusual market activity.

### Project of Fires from Space: Australia | June 2025- Aug 2025

* Collected and cleaned $\sim45,000$ NASA FIRMS VIIRS/MODIS fire detections; standardized coordinates/timestamps and removed $\sim12\%$ low-confidence pixels.

* Built daily fire-count time-series and regional bar charts revealing two major activity peaks (Aug 17-20 and Sep 12-15) with $>3,000$ detections per day.

* Generated kernel-density heat maps showing highest concentration in eastern New South Wales and northern Queensland; quantified hotspots with **Getis-Ord** $G_i^*$ statistics.

* Integrated results into an interactive CARTO map and 10-second animated timeline highlighting temporal surges and spatial clusters across Australia.

### DataFest 2025 (Commercial Site Selection Analysis) | Feb 2025-March 2025

* Cleaned and processed 10,000+ leasing records in R, applied time-series smoothing to track trends, revealing a steady increase in Class A leases during the pandemic.

* Analyzed spatial patterns and correlations between CBD and suburban markets; found suburban leasing peaked at $\sim60\%$ in 2020-2021 and returned to $\sim50/50$ by 2024.

* Ranked submarkets using **regression and scoring metrics**, producing actionable recommendations for hybrid-location strategies and Class O asset repositioning.
